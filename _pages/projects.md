|Visualization Alliance|
|-----------------------|
|The "Visualization Alliance" project, led by Jason Leigh (U. Hawaii at Manoa), considers research questions that arise when building and managing a cyberinfrastructure for visualization of data and cooperative work across geographically distributed sites. Each CENTRA site has a visualization wall, and associated computers and storage resources to execute a tool (SAGE2) that allows different walls to be shared and synchronized, and ancillary data analytics and simulations. SAGE2 has been developed by J. Leigh's group at Hawaii at Manoa and the Electronic Visualization Laboratory of the U. Illinois at Chicago. Current sites include institutions in the USA (U. Hawaii at Manoa and U. Florida), Taiwan (NCHC) and Japan (AIST and Osaka U.). The domain contexts for the research questions addressed by this project includes decision support and outreach in energy, coral reef, water, and disaster management. The middleware research context includes the leveraging of Software Defined Networks to provide network QoS, security and integration for critical decision support. Additional IT issues considered include the use of persistent data identifiers to better enable the joining of data sets to be visualized, support for merging big-data analysis with machine learning, and the development of a tool for distributed cooperative computer-enhanced brainstorming. <br> <br> <img src="../images/members/jasonleigh.jpg"  style="max-width: 15%; align: right"><br> Contact: Jason Leigh <br>Email: leighj (at) hawaii (dot) edu<br>|

| SDN-IP Peering for IOT Data Transmission|
|-----------------------|
|The "SDN-IP Peering for IOT Data Transmission" project, led by Te-Lung Liu (NCHC, Taiwan) and Shinji Shimojo (NICT, Japan) studies architectures and mechanisms to federate IP Networks with software-defined IP networking for resilient and effective infrastructure for disaster mitigation and smart city applications. In order to meet the needs of inter-domain transmissions, we would like to setup a adaptive network transmission testbed based on SDN-IP with efficiency, elasticity, security, and convenience. We exploit the L3 routing mechanism of SDN-IP for inter-domain communication for interconnecting several research sites. For end users, a local router is installed for distributing packets between SDN-IP and legacy Internet. Therefore, client hosts could transmit the packets without IP address modification. With their original IP addresses, the researchers could not only access legacy Internet but also exchange information over the SDN-IP backbone. <br> <br> <img src="../images/members/telungliu.jpg"  style="max-width: 15%; align: right"><br> Contact: Te-Lung Liu <br>Email: tlliu (at) nchc (dot) narl (dot) org (dot) tw<br>|

|Persistent Identifier (PID) Kernel Information|
|-----------------------|
|The "Persistent Identifier (PID) Kernel Information" project, led by Beth Plale (Indiana University), considers the problem of enabling persistent IDs (PIDs) in environmental and biodiversity data collections, using a Robust Persistent IDentifier (RPID) testbed to evaluate PID services. In part through engagement with the Research Data Alliance, the project is defining a minimal set of metadata (called PID kernel information) that travels with PIDs and can be processed at Internet speeds by data discovery services. The novelty of the work emerges when a small amount of data provenance is included amongst the kernel information. This provenance enables a universal provenance for research data, where all data objects created as a result of scientific research have data provenance associated with them, moving us to a world where assessments of fitness and trust for secondary use of research data can be done with far higher degrees of success than can be achieved today. <br> <br> <img src="../images/members/bethplale.jpg"  style="max-width: 15%; align: right"><br>Contact: Beth Plale <br>Email: plale (at) indiana (dot) edu<br>|

|IT for Natural Disaster Management|
|-----------------------|
|The "IT for Natural Disaster Management" project, led by Jason Haga (National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AST)), considers the use of distributed immersive visualization and analysis systems (developed under the Visualization Alliance) to support activities needed to respond to river-related disasters. This research uses an interdisciplinary effort to tackle a variety of areas including the development of novel interaction modalities for grappling with big datasets, heterogeneous data integration through layered/linked visualizations, userinterface/user-experience research to test and improve the usability of applications in immersive visualization environments, and infrastructure integration through flexible (SDN) networks to provide a level of resilience to the system. <br> <br> <img src="../images/members/jasonhaga.jpg"  style="max-width: 15%; align: right"><br> Contact: Jason Haga <br>Email: jh (dot) haga (at) aist (dot) go (dot) jp<br>|

|Overlay VPNs for Sensors, Edge and Cloud Resources|
|-----------------------|
|The "Overlay VPNs for Sensors, Edge and Cloud Resources" project, led by Renato Figueiredo (University of Florida), looks at dynamically connecting groups of trusted distributed Internet-of-Things (IOT) devices with edge and cloud resources in the same logical network using P2P overlay virtual private networks. It studies techniques for the dynamic instantiation of stream processing workflows across edge/cloud resources. Target applications include smart/connected community scenarios where users need to collaborate or cooperate in dynamic, time-limited ways and/or form ad-hoc groups, volunteering resources to help respond to emergencies. Overview of the project and recent development is available in this [video webinar recording](https://goo.gl/nS65pV) (October 10th, 2017) <br> <br> <img src="../images/members/renatofigueiredo.jpg"  style="max-width: 15%; align: right"><br> Contact: Renato Figueiredo <br>Email: renato (at) acis (dot) ufl (dot) edu<br>|

|Distributed Lifemapper|
|-----------------------|
|The "Distributed Lifemapper" project led by James Beach and Aimee Stewart (U. Kansas) is pursuing the use of species distribution and macroecological modeling for biogeographic, phylogenetic, and biodiversity analyses of plant and animal species in North America and Asia. The effort utilizes unique Lifemapper installations for CENTRA sites using researcher-specified or online species occurrence data along with observed climate and predicted climate data based on IPCC scenarios, as well as topographic and soils data to explain the ecological and evolutionary contributions to observed spatial patterns of species diversity. The Lifemapper platform is designed to work with Rocks clusters using the Rocks roll packaging system allowing it to be consistently deployed in different computational environments (Rocks software is developed and maintained by SDSC CENTRA researcher Phil Papadopoulos and his team). Rolls contain software packages as RPMs which configure the platform for particular virtual or physical hardware. The platform is deployed in the USA using virtual clusters in the XSEDE program's resource 'Comet' enabling agile and rapid scaling to match computational load. It is also deployed at the Nat. Center for HPC, NARLabs, Taiwan on OpenStack with Taiwanese data. In collaboration with the CENTRA Visualization Alliance this project is developing a compatible front-end Lifemapper application for the SAGE2 visualization wall for biogeographical pattern discovery and cooperative work across CENTRA countries.  <br> <br> <img src="../images/members/jamesbeach.jpg"  style="max-width: 15%; align: right"><br> Contact: James Beach <br>Email: beach (at) ku (dot) edu<br>|

|AirBox|
|-----------------------|
|The "AirBox" project, led by Ling-Jyh Chen (Academia Sinica, Taiwan), looks at the problem of designing and deploying affordable accurate sensors worldwide to measure particulate matter (PM2.5), aggregating data from these sensors, opening data to access by the public and analyzing the data to explain causes and detect sources of pollution across multiple countries. <br> <br> <img src="../images/members/lingjyhchen.jpg"  style="max-width: 15%; align: right"><br>Contact: Ling-Jyh Chen <br>Email: cclljj (at) gmail (dot) com<br>|
